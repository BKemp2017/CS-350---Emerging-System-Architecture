# Module 5 Milestone Project: Morse Code Message Display System

## Project Overview
The Module 5 Milestone Project is an inventive implementation of a Morse code message display system, primarily for educational and demonstrative purposes. It employs two LEDs (red and green) to represent "SOS" and "OK" messages in Morse code. The system enables users to toggle between these messages using buttons, providing an interactive experience. This project is a prime example of integrating hardware and software to create a functional and educational tool.

### Key Achievements
- **Effective Morse Code Implementation**: Accomplished by designing a state machine for controlling LED timing and sequences, accurately representing Morse code's dot and dash system.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Button-based controls for toggling between messages make the system user-friendly and accessible.
- **Organized Code Structure**: The code is logically structured, enhancing understanding, troubleshooting, and setting a foundation for future modifications.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Expandability**: Future versions could support a broader range of messages or allow custom message inputs, increasing versatility.
- **Power Management**: Optimizing power usage, especially for battery operation, could enhance the system's efficiency and longevity.
- **Robustness and Error Handling**: Improvements like button debouncing could lead to a more stable and reliable system.

### Tools and Resources Added
- **Timer and GPIO Drivers**: The use of Texas Instruments' drivers has been pivotal for managing timing sequences and input/output controls.
- **State Machine Design**: The state machine approach ensures a clear, maintainable, and efficient control system.
- **Documentation Practices**: Emphasis on comprehensive commenting and clear documentation aids current understanding and future scalability.

### Transferable Skills
- **State Machine Design**: This fundamental software engineering concept is applicable in various contexts, from UI development to complex system controls.
- **GPIO Handling Skills**: Essential for embedded systems and hardware interfacing projects.
- **Timer and Interrupt Management**: Vital for managing time-sensitive operations in many real-time systems.

### Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
- **Modularity and Code Structure**: The modular code structure enhances maintainability, allowing easy modifications and updates.
- **Clear Documentation and Commenting**: Detailed comments and documentation facilitate easy understanding and future development.
- **Scalable and Adaptable Framework**: The project's design supports the addition of new features or messages, ideal for more complex Morse code-related projects.
