# Module 5: Morse Code Message Display System

## Project Overview
The Module 5 project demonstrates an innovative Morse Code Message Display System using LEDs. This system, designed for educational purposes, effectively communicates "SOS" and "OK" messages in Morse code. It addresses the challenge of teaching Morse code through a hands-on, interactive approach.

### What Was Done Particularly Well
- **Accurate Morse Code Representation**: The project excels in translating Morse code messages into LED signals, demonstrating a keen understanding of both Morse code and electronic signaling.
- **User-Friendly Design**: The use of simple button controls for toggling between messages shows a thoughtful consideration for user experience.
- **Clear Code Structure**: The code is organized and well-commented, making it easy for others to understand and learn from.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Expandable Message Range**: Future enhancements could include a wider variety of Morse code messages or a feature for users to input custom messages.
- **Power Optimization**: Investigating and implementing power-saving techniques would make the system more eco-friendly and suitable for battery operation.

### Tools and Resources Added
- **Embedded System Drivers**: Leveraged Texas Instruments drivers to handle GPIO and timer functionalities, crucial for the project's success.
- **Practical Implementation of State Machines**: Utilized state machines to manage LED sequences, a technique that is beneficial in various programming scenarios.

### Transferable Skills
- **Embedded Systems Design**: The skills developed in managing hardware components and implementing state machines are highly transferable to other embedded system projects.
- **Problem-Solving and Creativity**: Tackling the challenge of converting Morse code into visual signals demonstrates problem-solving abilities and creative thinking.

### Maintaining, Readability, and Adaptability
- **Modular Design and Documentation**: The project is broken down into distinct, well-documented modules, each handling a specific aspect of the system. This approach not only makes the code more readable but also simplifies future modifications and enhancements.
